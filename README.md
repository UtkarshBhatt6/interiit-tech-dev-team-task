## Reflection

This is a task for entering into inter-iit tech dev team.I implemented this project using NewsAPI ,which is a very powerful API for scraping news from various sources.The project also uses mongoDB as the database for storing user's info who want to subscribe to newsletter service.The frontend of the app is built using Reactjs with React Bootstrap as the UI library.The backend uses Nodejs as the runtime environment and Expressjs as the framework.I have also containerized both frontend and backend of the application using Docker.
