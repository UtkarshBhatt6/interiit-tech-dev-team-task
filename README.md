## Reflection

This was a month-long project built during my summer holidays. Project goals included working with Google and OpenAI APIs. This is my first project using GenerativeAI to build products that simplify life.   
During this time I also researched authentication using Google OAuth protocol and how it can be used to gain limited access to a user's private resources. I also learned how to integrate Google Calendar into the web application. I also gained much experience working with OpenAI's endpoint, particularly for chat completion and using its text-DaVinci model for language processing.
I also learn a lot about prompt engineering and how to carefully design your prompt for getting the best results. The technologies used in this project are ReactJS for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend, Google OAuth for authentication,openAi's API for chat completion, and Google Calendar API for scheduling meetings.
